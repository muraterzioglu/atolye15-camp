## Usage
You can find all the details about project at our [wiki page](https://github.com/muraterzioglu/atolye15-camp/wiki). Tasks, applications ve GraphQL schemas explained in here!

## Setup
Actually I would like to use Yarn 2 with Plug'n'Play but seems like Apollo has some problems with that, that's why `nodeLinker` option set as `node-modules`
```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Komutlar

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn start:prod
```
